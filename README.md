##  Why this was needed

Because (sorry) OpenZeppelin contracts are old and full of useless gas expensive code.

## Terms of use

Do what you want respecting the MIT license.

## How to use

Our goal is to provide easy to use and to read interfaces. 
Most of the times you would just be required to copypaste the contract you need to implement and strip down the compiler and license part.

Sometimes you may find an include: is up to you if to download the included file or flatten it. Anyway, no callback here (you are welcome, vscode users).
